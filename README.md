I srongly belive we the professionals of tech industry need to learn and innovate.There is a constant change in technologies in the tech market we need to update ourselves with. The only thing that is constant is change. I would call myself an intersection of developer & designer. Currently I an playing with JAVASCRIPT and FRONT-END DEVLOPMENT. Its the place where I stay focused on. I love trying out new technologies and update with mordern tools helping our lives faster and easier.

:) Happy Coding !
